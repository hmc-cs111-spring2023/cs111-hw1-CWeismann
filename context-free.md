# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
People who enjoy creating art, whether they have a CS background or not.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
Draw regular shapes, like circles and squares, in precise locations, with
consistent and perfect coloring.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Create natural shapes; it's difficult to create something that looks smooth
and human-created out of very exact shapes.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
Reading the documentation and looking at example programs

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
There is a random element- 50% of the time, the teal shapes will be circles; the other 50%
of the time, they will be squares.
